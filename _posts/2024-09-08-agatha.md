# Agatha

Agatha is a collection entries from my analog [pocket notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34V74B0qVZo&t=1s&ab_channel=JoeVanCleave).

My pocket notebook has been the most important tool at many stages of life.
I used a pocket notebook as:

- A university student
- A researcher
- A programmer
- A mentor
- A tutor
- An engineer

I use this information a lot.
So, it should be easily accessible to me.
These days, the web runs on everything.
There's a good chance I can reach a browser and internet connection from
almost anywhere.

If you found Agatha helpful, please feel free to reach out to
elliotsmakerspace@gmail.com to let me know.

Special thanks to [e#850...](_Coming Soon_) from the [Encyclopedia Agatha](_Coming Soon_).

## Notes

Records thoughts and observations.

## Tasks

Records TODO:

- [ ] Is a task to be completed
- [x] Is a task that has been completed
- [v] Is equivalent to \-\[x\] for a single line

## Comments

I mostly use these to make jokes.
Occasionally, comments provide useful context to whatever I'm thinking at the
moment of writing.

## Events

_Simply record what happens when it's interesting._

## Priority

Numbering items from 1 to N can be a useful way to prioritize tasks.
