### Now

A _Now Page_ is about what I'm doing right now.

Right now, I'm...

Living in Missouri, but looking for somewhere much colder and wetter
to live.

Planning a trip to Central America. This trip will be the first time that
I travel abroad - but certainly not the last.

Running further, frequently, and with friends. In September 2024,
I joined a weekly run club. Since then, I look forward to Thursday
more than the weekend.

Making things for myself. I'm exhausted by monetization, [deceptive design](https://www.deceptive.design/),
and advertisements, especially on the web. I'm choosing to make what I can,
with what I have, and sharing it freely.

Celebrating 9 wonderful years with my cat!

I learned about the _Now Page_ from [this website](https://nownownow.com/about).
